This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion and array indexing. The `myFunction` function attempts to handle both string and numeric inputs, but fails to properly check input types before performing operations. This can lead to errors if the input is not of the expected type or if array indexing is performed on something that's not an array.  The solution shows how to properly handle these situations by explicitly checking input types and using appropriate error handling.
